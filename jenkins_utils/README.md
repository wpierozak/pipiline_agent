## Status

This module is marked for deprecation and will be refactored in a future release. The current implementation has dependencies and patterns that need to be updated to align with the current architecture.

- **BuildData.py** - Build data structures
- **Job.py** - Jenkins job management

## Migration Path

**TBD** - Awaiting refactoring design.

If you need Jenkins integration functionality, please:
1. Avoid using this module in new code
2. Document your use case for consideration in the refactored design
3. Contact the development team for alternative approaches
